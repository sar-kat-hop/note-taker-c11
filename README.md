# Note Taker (Challenge 11)

## Purpose

This is a work-in-progress note taking app using Node.js and Express. When working as intended, users can add notes that will be saved to a json file. Notes will be read and appended to the landing page, where users can click on individual notes to edit or delete. 

Please note that the app is deployed via Heroku but not currently functioning due to problems with routing. The app is not routing to the landing page or successfully fetching the api. However, the app can be accessed locally but is not currently saving notes (css is not loading and the save button is unclickable).

## Installation

Visit the deployed app on Heroku [here](https://c11-notetaker.herokuapp.com/).

## Screenshots

The following screenshots are mockups of what the app will look like when working:

## Contributions

The fsUtils.js file is borrowed from class activities. It is intended to assist with reading, writing, and appending notes dynamically to the landing page.
